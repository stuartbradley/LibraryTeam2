Good morning, 
I want a system that allows me to keep track of books and audio books. When a customer wants to loan a book, they will be allowed to have that book for 3 weeks, and an audio book is for 4 weeks. They can renew each for another 2 weeks, they will have to return it and wait a week before taking them back out again. 
We can have multiple versions of the same book. We can also order new books in, if we have no copies available. When we order a book, it will take 1 week to arrive.
If someone is late with a book or audio book it is a 50p charge per day with a max amount of Â£7.50
If the person loses the book or audio book, we will need store the price of it so we can charge the customer the full amount. 
We would like to store the data in a database, so when the system shuts down, we keep all relevant data.
